# PyBer Analysis


## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to help the CEO of Pyber, a python based ride sharing app company, to analyse and visualize 
rides sharing data. In particular, the goal is to study the relationship between the total fare paid by the rider versus the 
month of the year (from January, 2019 to early May, 2019) for various city type.   

The analysis will help Pyber in improving access to ride sharing services and determining the affordability to underserved neighbourhoods.

The analysis was performed using CSV files, city_data.csv, and ride_data.csv, which can be found in the Resources folder. The complete code for the analysis can be found here, http://github.com/dshetty100/PyBerAnalysis
