# PyBer Analysis


## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to help the CEO of Pyber, a python based ride-sharing app company, to analyze and visualize 
ride-sharing data. In particular, the goal is to study the relationship between the total fare paid by the rider versus the 
month of the year (from January 2019 to early May 2019) for various city types. The analysis will help Pyber in improving 
access to ride-sharing services and determining the affordability to underserved neighborhoods.

The analysis was performed using CSV files, city_data.csv, and ride_data.csv, which can be found in the Resources folder. 
The complete code for the analysis can be found here, http://github.com/dshetty100/PyBer_Analysis



## Results
The analysis results for the total rides undertaken, total drivers employed, total ride fares, average fare per ride, and the average fare per driver 
are shown in the table below.

- It is observed that the total rides, total drivers, and total fares, are the highest for urban cities and lowest for rural cities.
- The average fare per ride and average fare per driver is observed to be the highest for the rural cities and lowest for the urban cities. 

The analysis results for the total fare by city type are shown in the graph below. The result is for the ride undertaken from January 2019 to early May 2019.

- It is observed that total fares for urban cities are the highest and those for the rural cities are the lowest. 

## Summary
The results show that Pyber can improve the disparity in total fare among city types by doing the following:  
 - providing more access to ride-sharing services in the rural neighbourhoods.
 - Providing affordable average fare per ride to underserved neighborhoods.
 - and, increasing the number of rides will increase the total fare and bring down the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver.
